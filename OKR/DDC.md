# Dynamic Data and Capabilities OKRs

We frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

### DDC 2019 Q1 OKRs

#### O1: Peer-base is attractive and welcoming to new developers

* P0, @pgte: Peer-base release management is well defined and optimal
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base core values and vision are clearly defined.
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has a roadmap reflecting its goals, and incremental milestones.
* P2, @marcooliveira: Peer-base early market audience personas with demographics and psychographics are defined.
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base is framed, as a product, in a compelling way for its audience, with an attuned and clear message.
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has a strong brand identity, namely logo and brand manual, aligned with its values, vision and audience.
* P2, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has an acquisition funnel for each persona, taking into account both online and offline initiatives
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has a communication strategy, aligned with the roadmap and acquisition funnel.
* P0, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has a website which onboards and is a continuous reference for its personas, containing relevant information, namely architecture, principles, glossary, API docs, app blueprints/case studies, advantages/benefits, whoâ€™s behind the project, goals, community info, roadmap, exact list to be defined.
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has and maintains a set of channels for communicating with and activating its audience, namely the website, social media presence, repositories, newsletter, podcast, exact list to be defined.
* P2, @marcooliveira: Peer-base website integrates with proto.school, and any learning material is kept there.
* P1, @marcooliveira: Peer-base has a glossary of unambiguous and hopefully cross-tech terms, allowing for a unified language.
* P0, @adin.schmahmann: Peer-base constructs are defined and explained (Constructs: App, Collaboration, Membership, Peer Discovery in Collaborations, Collaboration Persistence and Propagation, Causality, Identity, Message Queuing)
* P0, @adin.schmahmann: Peer-base components are listed, defined, and classified based on criteria such as: stability (deprecated, experimental, stable) and modularity (not swappable, difficult to swap, easily swappable),
* P0, @pgte: The required infrastructural services are documented well enough to allow Devops to implement Continuous Delivery of these services.
* P1, @pgte: Static assets are pinnable alongside dynamic data.
* P1, @pgte: The state machine for connection management in peer-base is defined and implemented (paving the way for more deterministic connection management).
* P0, @jimpick: Community, outbound: Articles and videos where people can learn how to build Dynamic DApps on top of IPFS exist (planning with Community WG)
* P1, ???: Community, Workshops: a frequently-recurring workshop is delivered throughout the world, recruiting community members and gathering feedback. (ask from Juan)
* P2, @???: Community, Workshops: a feedback process for participants is created and part of the workshop delivery. (ask from Juan)
* P1, @pgte: Peer-base works well offline (depends on js-ipfs +internal tests and work)
* P1, @adin.schmahmann: Peer-base enables locating and updating/synchronizing a named multi-writer persistent data structure that works with eventual consistency semantics.
* P1, @adin.schmahmann: Peer-base has a proposal for a message queuing system (depends on libp2p WG)

#### O2: DApps built on top of IPFS have User Experience guidelines

* P0, @andre.sousa: The collaboration lifecycle guideline is defined
* P1, @jimpick: The collaboration lifecycle recommendations in the UI is implemented on peer-pad

#### O3: Identity solutions for IPFS-based DApps are getting more concrete

* P0, @satazor: An evolving spec for human-friendly way to identify users in DApps was debated and approved, generating the IDM Spec v0.1
* P1, @pgte: peer-base supports identity agonistically, so that developers can integrate their own identity solution, either centralized or decentralized
* P0, @andre.sousa: New design iteration of Identity Manager is concluded and contains all necessary user-journeys
* P1, @andre.sousa: A style-guide for the Identity Manager is created
* P1, @pedro.santos: The Identity Manager style-guide components are implemented
* P1, @satazor: The Identity Manager sandboxed frontend project is kickstarted and provides the user-journeys for creating/importing DID:IPID identities, management of social verifiable claims and authentication to DApps
* P0, @satazor: The low-level modules to create and import DID:IPID based identities are concluded
* P1, @satazor: The low-level modules to create, update and sync social verifiable claims are concluded
* P1, @satazor: The low-level modules to provide authentication to DApps are concluded
* P1, @???: Hire an Identity-focused user experience design lead (user research specialist)

#### O4: DApp Reference implementations are getting mature and adopted

* P0, @pedro.santos: Users can see the history of any comments
* P0, @pedro.santos: Discussions are persisted via the pinner as well as their comments (depends on KR1.6)

#### O5: The DDC WG has started developing relationships with partners
* P1, @adin.schmahmann: Identify and work/partner with a third party on development of a production-quality collaborative application
